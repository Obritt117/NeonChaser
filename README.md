# NeonChaser
Game Concept: Neon Chaser was an idea I had to make a retro 2D platformer of a storm chaser trying to dodge a moving tornado, something you might play at an Arcade back then. My vision was a Storm Chaser in the endless Texas Plains trying to escape from a fast-moving tornado. 

Game Mechanics: The player, using the WASD Keys, must try to avoid the tornado at all costs for 10 seconds. The Tornado uses points on the map that it will travel to in order, while the Player can move the Storm Chaser anywhere on the map. 

Basic Requirements: The game is made in Unity 2D, a singleplayer game, playable with the WASD keys on the keyboard, takes 10 seconds to beat the game, a tutorial on how to play the game, a goal (which is to survive for 10 seconds), and both a win and lose state. 

Audio Requirements: the game features a background song that was created by me on BandLab, I have recorded myself explaining what to do for the beginning annoucement, two distinct sounds for both the lose and win outcomes, and sound effects (such as the wind, truck driving and engine turning on), all from Pixabay.Com. (This also includes the win and lose game sounds) 

Visial Requirements: The game features pixel art from KeawStudio, with their Unity asset "Backyard Top-Down Tiles." Using a Tile Palette from this asset, I made it into a background for the game. Using Aesprite, I created the Red Truck Sprite, The Tornado, The Radar Screen that depicts the timer, and the Edges of the map. For the particles, I used it to make overlay rain and the Debris Cloud (in Brown) of the tornado. Finally, the game features a UI timer in the Top-Right corner of the screen to depict how many seconds left the player has to beat the game.
